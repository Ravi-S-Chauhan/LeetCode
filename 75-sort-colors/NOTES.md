pointer low,mid(initilaized to 0) and high(N-1)
run a while loop till mid<=high ->1,2,3
1 if mid == 1 continue as we want 1 in the middle
2 if mid == 0 swap with low and increment both as we want 1 in the begining
3. if mid == 2 swap with high and decrement high not the mid
as we have not yet came across high pointers element we dont want to miss 1 or 2
